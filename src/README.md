# WPGraphiQL

WPGraphiQL is a port of the GraphiQL IDE, enqueued in the WordPress dashboard, and tailored to the
WPGraphQL experience.

WPGraphiQL is built with hooks/filters in mind, so plugin authors can customize the experience and
provide tooling for their users to make the experience of using GraphiQL a pleasant one.
